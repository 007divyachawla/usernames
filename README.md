# usernames

 Last names were pulled from mongabay (http://names.mongabay.com/data/1000.html) and are the top 1000 in order of most to    least common.
 
 I forgot where I pulled the list of first names from. I searched for top names and grabbed the tables from the first result. 
 
 If anyone has names from census data please hit me up on twitter (@strupo_) and let me know.
